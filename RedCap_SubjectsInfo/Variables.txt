Fat (g) / Tissue (g) = Tissue (%Fat) = Fat (g) / [Fat (g) + Lean (g)]
Fat (g) / T-Mass (kg) = Region (%Fat) = Fat (g) / [Fat (g) + Lean (g) + BMC (g)]


Fat (g) + Lean (g) = Tissue (g) 
Lean (g) + BMC (g) = Fat Free (g)
Fat (g) + Fat Free (g) = T-Mass (kg) or Fat (g) + Lean (g) + BMC (g) = T-Mass (kg) 

BMC (g): Bone Mineral Content. This is amount of bone tissue your skeleton (or a section of it) currently has. This value is expressed in grams (g).
Fat Free (g): The sum of lean mass and bone mineral content yields your Fat Free Mass. 

Bone density Z-score chart
This table shows the meanings of different Z-scores:

Z-score	Meaning
+1–2	Bone density is higher than in others of the same age, sex, and body size.
0	Bone density is the same as in others of the same age, sex, and body size.
-1	Bone density is lower than in others of the same age, sex, and body size.
-2	Doctors consider scores higher than this to be normal.
-2.5	This score or lower indicatesTrusted Source secondary osteoporosis.


T-scores versus Z-scores
T-scores reflect how bone density compares with that of a typical, young, healthy person, whereas Z-scores use the bone density of those with similar characteristics for comparison.

Healthcare professionals may provide DEXA scan results via T-scores and Z-scores. T-scores reveal how high or low a person’s bone density is compared with that of a typical healthy 30-year-old. The lower the scores, the lower the bone density.

T-score	Meaning
-1.0 or higher	normal
-1.0 to -2.5	osteopenia, which indicates that the bone mass is low but not low enough to classify as osteoporosis
-2.5 or below	osteoporosis
